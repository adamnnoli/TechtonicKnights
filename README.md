# We are Techtonic Labs
Techtonic Knights is a cardgame where every card is an NFT. While many versions of the same card may exist they all will have their own randomized artwork in the future which can be purchased directly from ourselves off of our marketplace and then later traded with other people.
The Game itself is based off of the LibGDX library which provides a great amount of base functionality.
Additionally, this game was made off the back of Walker Whites 3152 Intro to Game Dev Lab 1.
The majority of the Art Assets and code within these files are the team's.
We have permission from Walker White to use said lab to base any and all commercial games off of so long as he retains a proprietary copy of the sourcecode and a free copy to show off to future year's classes.

The App is the interface for users to manage their accounts and decks.
Here they can view their decks, buy new cards from other players in the marketplace,
trade cards with other players, and buy new card packs for NRCs and NRCs for dollars.
The App was implemented using scaffold-eth as a framework, rewriting their smart contract
and their react code.
To view the App run yarn chain, then in a new terminal run yarn deploy and then yarn start.
